Generates three 10x10 tables showing the time in nanoseconds to compute a power operation.


Unit tests check if the power matches the result from Math.pow

Nanosecond timers are also in the for loop.


There is an error with 0^0. Java says 0^0=1 and mine returns 0^0=0. I didn't bother fixing it since the pseudocode checked x=0 first.

I did not use a short path name to export the CSV. It will make a new directory in C.
